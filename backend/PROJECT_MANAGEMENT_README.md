# Enhanced Project Management Agent with Structured Types

## Overview

The Project Management Agent has been enhanced to use structured Pydantic models that mirror the shared TypeScript schemas from `shared/schemas/typescript/project.ts`. This provides better type safety, consistency with the frontend, and improved data validation.

## Structured Models

### Core Models

-  **`Project`** - Main project entity with fields like `project_id`, `client_id`, `project_name`, etc.
-  **`ProjectPhase`** - Project phase with phase-specific fields and lifecycle management
-  **`ProjectTask`** - Individual tasks with assignments, estimates, and progress tracking
-  **`ProjectTeam`** - Team organization and management
-  **`StafferAssignment`** - Resource assignment to tasks

### Request Models

-  **`ProjectCreateRequest`** - Structured request for creating new projects
-  **`ProjectUpdateRequest`** - Fields that can be updated on existing projects
-  **`PhaseCreateRequest`** - Request model for creating project phases
-  **`TaskCreateRequest`** - Request model for creating project tasks

### Response Models

-  **`ProjectResponse`** - Database response with structured Project data
-  **`PhaseResponse`** - Database response with structured ProjectPhase data
-  **`TaskResponse`** - Database response with structured ProjectTask data
-  **`ProjectDetailsResponse`** - Complete project details with phases, tasks, and teams
-  **`ClientsResponse`** - List of available clients

## API Endpoints

### 1. General Project Management Queries

```http
POST /api/v1/project-management/query
```

**Request Body:**

```json
{
   "query": "Create a project plan for mobile app development",
   "project_context": "Client: TechCorp, Timeline: 3 months"
}
```

### 2. Create Project Plan

```http
POST /api/v1/project-management/create
```

**Request Body:**

```json
{
   "project_name": "Mobile App Development",
   "client_id": "uuid-client-id",
   "project_status": "RFP",
   "project_start_date": "2024-01-15",
   "project_due_date": "2024-04-15",
   "description": "iOS/Android app development"
}
```

### 3. Analyze Project Health

```http
GET /api/v1/project-management/analyze/{project_id}
```

## Database Tools with Type Safety

All database tools now return structured responses:

### Create Project Record

```python
@tool
def create_project_record(
    project_name: str,
    client_id: str,
    project_status: str = "RFP",
    project_start_date: Optional[str] = None,
    project_due_date: Optional[str] = None
) -> ProjectResponse:
```

### Create Project Phase

```python
@tool
def create_project_phase(
    phase_request: PhaseCreateRequest
) -> PhaseResponse:
```

### Create Project Task

```python
@tool
def create_project_task(
    task_request: TaskCreateRequest
) -> TaskResponse:
```

### Get Project Details

```python
@tool
def get_project_details(project_id: str) -> ProjectDetailsResponse:
```

## Benefits of Structured Types

1. **Type Safety** - Pydantic models provide runtime type validation
2. **Consistency** - Models mirror TypeScript interfaces used in frontend
3. **Documentation** - Self-documenting through model field definitions
4. **Validation** - Automatic validation of request/response data
5. **IDE Support** - Better autocomplete and error detection
6. **Maintainability** - Changes to types are propagated throughout the system

## Example Usage

### Creating a Project with Structured Data

```python
from app.models.project import ProjectCreateRequest
from app.agents.project_management import create_project_record

# Create structured request
project_request = ProjectCreateRequest(
    project_name="E-commerce Platform",
    client_id="client-uuid-here",
    project_status="Active",
    project_start_date="2024-02-01",
    project_due_date="2024-08-01",
    description="Full-stack e-commerce solution"
)

# Create project record
response = create_project_record(
    project_name=project_request.project_name,
    client_id=project_request.client_id,
    project_status=project_request.project_status,
    project_start_date=project_request.project_start_date,
    project_due_date=project_request.project_due_date
)

if response.success:
    print(f"Created project: {response.project.project_name}")
    print(f"Project ID: {response.project.project_id}")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.error}")
```

### Analyzing Project with Structured Response

```python
from app.agents.project_management import get_project_details

# Get structured project details
details = get_project_details("project-uuid-here")

if details.success:
    project = details.project
    phases = details.phases
    tasks = details.tasks

    print(f"Project: {project.project_name}")
    print(f"Status: {project.project_status}")
    print(f"Total Phases: {len(phases)}")
    print(f"Total Tasks: {len(tasks)}")

    for phase in phases:
        print(f"  Phase {phase.project_phase_number}: {phase.project_phase_name}")
else:
    print(f"Error retrieving project: {details.error}")
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify structured types integration:

```bash
python backend/test_project_management.py
```

The test suite includes:

-  Environment configuration validation
-  Supabase connection testing
-  Database tools with structured types
-  Agent functionality with type safety
-  API endpoint testing

## Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are set:

```env
# Bedrock AI Configuration
AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=your-bedrock-api-key
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=us.anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0

# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-supabase-service-key
```

## Migration Notes

-  All database tools now return structured response objects instead of dictionaries
-  API endpoints use structured request models for better validation
-  Type hints throughout the codebase provide better development experience
-  Error handling is more consistent with structured error responses
