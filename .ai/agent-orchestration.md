# Agent Orchestration Strategy

## Overview
Collaborative agent architecture where all user interactions go through a central orchestrator, and agents can call each other to complete complex tasks.

## Architecture Pattern

### Entry Point: Always Orchestrator
- All Next.js UI interactions route through the orchestrator agent
- Users never directly invoke specialized agents
- Orchestrator determines which agents to engage and in what order
- Provides unified interface for complex multi-agent workflows

### Collaborative Agent Network
```
User Request → Orchestrator Agent → Specialized Agents → Cross-Agent Collaboration
```

### Agent Interaction Flow
1. **User initiates request** through Next.js UI
2. **Orchestrator receives** and analyzes the request
3. **Orchestrator delegates** to appropriate specialized agent(s)
4. **Specialized agents collaborate** with each other as needed
5. **Results consolidated** by orchestrator before returning to user

## Collaborative Patterns

### Sequential Collaboration
```
User: "Create a project plan and assign the team for a mobile app project"

Orchestrator → Project Management Agent: Create project plan
            ↓
Project Management Agent → Resourcing Agent: Get team recommendations
            ↓
Resourcing Agent → Quotes Agent: Validate resource costs
            ↓
All results → Orchestrator: Consolidate and present
```

### Parallel Collaboration
```
User: "Analyze our Q3 capacity and profitability outlook"

Orchestrator → Project Management Agent: Forecast project timelines
            → Resourcing Agent: Analyze capacity constraints  
            → Quotes Agent: Review pipeline and revenue projections
            ↓
All results → Orchestrator: Synthesize comprehensive analysis
```

### Cross-Agent Consultation
```
Quotes Agent needs resource cost estimates
            ↓
Quotes Agent → Resourcing Agent: "What's the cost for a senior React developer for 3 months?"
            ↓
Resourcing Agent → Quotes Agent: Returns current rates and availability
```

## Implementation with Strands SDK

### Orchestrator Agent Structure
```python
from strands import Agent, tool
from .project_management_agent import project_management_agent
from .resourcing_agent import resourcing_agent  
from .quotes_agent import quotes_agent

ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT = """
You are the PSA system orchestrator. You coordinate specialized agents to fulfill user requests.

Available agents:
- project_management_agent: Project planning, tracking, optimization
- resourcing_agent: Team allocation, capacity planning, resource optimization
- quotes_agent: Cost estimation, proposal generation, competitive analysis

For complex requests, you should:
1. Break down the request into agent-specific tasks
2. Coordinate agent execution (sequential or parallel as appropriate)
3. Allow agents to collaborate with each other
4. Synthesize results into a comprehensive response

Always think through the optimal agent workflow before proceeding.
"""

orchestrator = Agent(
    system_prompt=ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT,
    tools=[project_management_agent, resourcing_agent, quotes_agent]
)
```

### Cross-Agent Communication Pattern
```python
@tool
def project_management_agent(request: str, context: dict = None) -> str:
    """
    Handle project management tasks with ability to consult other agents.
    """
    # Primary project management logic
    result = process_project_request(request)
    
    # If resource planning needed, consult resourcing agent
    if requires_resource_planning(request):
        resource_context = {
            "project_scope": result.scope,
            "timeline": result.timeline,
            "skills_needed": result.required_skills
        }
        resource_plan = resourcing_agent(
            f"Create resource plan for: {result.project_name}", 
            resource_context
        )
        result.resource_plan = resource_plan
    
    return result
```

### Agent-to-Agent Collaboration Logging
```python
class AgentCollaborationLogger:
    def __init__(self, session_id: str):
        self.session_id = session_id
        
    def log_agent_call(self, calling_agent: str, called_agent: str, purpose: str):
        supabase.from('agent_collaboration_logs').insert({
            'session_id': self.session_id,
            'calling_agent': calling_agent,
            'called_agent': called_agent,
            'purpose': purpose,
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        })
        
    def log_thinking(self, agent_name: str, message: str):
        supabase.from('agent_logs').insert({
            'session_id': self.session_id,
            'agent_name': agent_name,
            'message': message,
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        })
```

## User Experience Flow

### Single Agent Scenarios
```
User: "Show me the status of Project ABC"
→ Orchestrator identifies this as pure project management
→ Delegates to Project Management Agent only
→ Returns project status directly
```

### Multi-Agent Scenarios
```
User: "We need to fast-track Project XYZ delivery by 2 weeks"
→ Orchestrator analyzes complexity
→ Project Management Agent: Analyzes timeline compression options
→ Resourcing Agent: Checks for additional resource availability
→ Quotes Agent: Calculates cost impact of timeline changes
→ Orchestrator: Presents integrated options with trade-offs
```

### Agent Collaboration Visibility
Users see real-time thinking logs showing:
- Orchestrator analysis and delegation decisions
- Individual agent processing
- Cross-agent consultations and data exchanges
- Final synthesis and recommendation generation

## Concurrency Model: FIFO with Optimistic Concurrency

### Request Queue Management
- All orchestrator requests enter FIFO queue
- Each request gets unique session ID
- Optimistic concurrency for data updates
- Conflict resolution at data layer

### Agent Session Management
```typescript
interface AgentSession {
  id: string
  user_id: string
  request: string
  status: 'queued' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed'
  agents_involved: string[]
  started_at: timestamp
  completed_at?: timestamp
  result?: any
}
```

### Optimistic Updates
- UI shows immediate optimistic updates
- Background agents process actual changes
- Conflict resolution handles data inconsistencies
- Real-time sync keeps UI current

## Benefits of This Architecture
